    <p>
      Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a sharp increase
      in market activity, especially among younger audiences. Interestingly
      enough, there's been a correlation between stock prices and social media
      posts, primarily from famous or powerful celebrity figures.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to inform younger users and help them understand market
      volatility and manipulation, we created a visualization to analyze the
      correlation between Tesla (TSLA) stock prices and Elon Musk's tweets. This
      visualization also serves as a way to better epxlore the sphere of
      influences popular social figures can have and the impact on the market.

      This visualization was built using React v17.0.1, D3.js v6.5.0,
      Material-UI v4.11.3, and utilized the Twitter API v2.0 and the Yahoo
      Finance API v4.2 (unofficial endpoint API).
