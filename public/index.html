    <h1>Crime Data Mapped Across the UIUC Campus</h1>
    <p>
      Crime on campus has been a growing concern for students, especially since the start of quarantine.
      We have heard a lot of warnings via word-of-mouth about certain areas and streets on campus that may be potentially dangerous or
      having an increase of crime. We wanted to visualize crime data from the University of Illinois Police Department's official crime records
      against a map of campus to help inform students about what areas would be safer or "unsafe." We hope this will be especially helpful for new students
      who are more unfamiliar with campus, as well as perhaps for the UIPD itself.

    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, we want to analyze what parts of campus could be considered crime "hot spots" or have higher frequencies or incidents,
      as well as what types of crimes are more common on campus areas versus off-campus areas. We also want to examine the frequency of crime
      during specific time periods, such as weekdays or weekends.

    </p>

    <p>While all the utilized data is public information, we recognize possible ethical concerns with this visualization
    such as alerting users to high traffic police presences or places of low patrol. We also realize that our dataset is limited and could be
  skewed by certain locations or repeat offenders so we ask that this visualization be used for exploration only.</p>

      This visualization was built using React v17.0.1, D3.js v6.5.0, Material-UI v4.11.3, and
    </br> utilized the Google Maps Embed API and Google Maps JavaScript API,
    </br> as well as crime data from the <a id="introLink" href="https://police.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Police Department</a>.
