  <h1>Stock Market Manipulation through Social Media</h1>
  <h2>Welcome!</h2>

  <p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a sharp increase in market activity, especially among younger audiences. Interestingly enough, there's been a correlation between stock prices and social media posts, primarily from famous or powerful celebrity figures.</p>

  <p>In order to inform younger users and help them understand market volatility and manipulation, we created a visualization to analyze the correlation between Tesla (TSLA) stock prices and Elon Musk's tweets. This visualization also serves as a way to better epxlore the sphere of influences popular social figures can have and the impact on the market. </p>

  <p>All communications and data are public information.</p>

  <p class="toolset" >This visualization was built using React v17.0.1, D3.js v6.5.0, Material-UI v4.11.3, and utilized the Twitter API v2.0 and the Yahoo Finance API v4.2 (unofficial endpoint API).</p>
